## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the teams with highest trophies. Then also showed the most runners-up in world cup history. I also plotted all countries wins, losses and draws.

Then I use a pie chart to show the percantage of wins for being the home team over being the away side. Also, which tournament year had the most goals.
I finally concentrated on attendance, stadium with the highest attendance, which city and the tournament that produced the most attendance.
